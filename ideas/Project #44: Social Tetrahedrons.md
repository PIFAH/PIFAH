# Mark Frazier's Social Tetrahedrons

This has a [repo](https://github.com/PubInv/SocialTetrahedrons).

This is Mr. Mark Frazier's attempt to model the 4-dimension of a human need, such as Mind,Body, Spirt, and Abundance, where 
Abundance is the height in a modified Maslow's Pyramid.

We are coding it using Three.js, please see the repo for more information.
