# Motile Ferrofluid Snail/Slug

Imainge a pair of coils, about 1 cm in dimater, separated by about 0.5 cm. Imagine then with current flowing in the same direction,
but controllable in the sense that the current to one or the other maybe be doubled.

Now imagine 5 pairs of such coils with their axes vertical arranged horizontally, a little like (IIIII). Now if this
is immersed in ferrofluid and sufficiently energized it will be covered in ferrofluid, even against the force of 
gravity.

Imagine now that one moves the greater current in a circular pattern. That is, imagine the top coil of each pair
receiving greater current in turn, so that a lump of ferrofluid is carried to one end. Then at the end the bottom coils is 
maximally energized, moving the lump to the bottom.  The wave then moves in the opposite direction along the bottom,
until the process repeats.  This entire assembly will potentially move on the basis of the anisotropic flow along the bottom.

This would only take about 2 days to test out.  Potentially the frame would have to be constructed to hold the coils and
the coils would have to be wound. An arduino program in combination with a motor shield with 10 channels would have to be 
created to control the addtional voltage (or possibly relays, or a transistor, or a multiplexer could be used.)
