# Passive Ferrofluid Check Valve

Ferrofluid has been used in a variety of micro-pumping and cooling applications, often associated with the idea of a "lab-on-chip". A number of active valves
have been developed. Because a pump knows its pumping state, active valves are sufficient to build small pumps.

However, it would be elegant to have a ferrofluid check valve of one-way valve that was completely passive, using permanent magnets with no electricity of moving
parts beside the ferrofluid itself.

I have racked my brains over this problem, and believe I have now found solutions (that have many limitations.) These are captured in these diagrams:
