It would be a minor mathmematical miracle and incredible useful if somoene could develope a linkage (in the precise mechanical definition of a linkage) that acted as a continuously variable
tranmission.

I hve worked on this a bit and I suspect it is not technically possible, at least as a planar linkage.  3-dimensional linkages
are so complex that I don't feel that I have any intuition about them.

However, I do believe it is possible to make something much less than a pure mechanical linkage that nevertheless could be 
extremely valuable.

Imagine a 4-bar linkage where the central bar is what I call a "stop-stick".  That is, it is mechanically a bar consisting of
two sliding components, one attached to each of the to non-ground bars in the linkage.

The Stop-Stick has the property that it can electronically be switched to provide resistance to lengthening and contracting.
One ccan imagine a linear synchronous motor (such as the ones I have played with on YouTube).  In stead of being used as a motor,
it is used as a generator, or more clearly, as a "regenerative braking system."

Then as the linkage is driven in a circle, you switch on and off the resistive power of the Stop-Stick at the apropriate times to drive
the other bar of the linkage. In this way you can effectively build a 4-bar linkage which is a continuously variable 
transmission.  This can be accomplished either by timing the interaction appropriately using the angles of the two 
bars, or, simply by varying the length of one of the bars, and using the stop-stick to match linear speed.  If you 
match the linear speed in a short section of the arc of rotation between two arms or different length, you are providing 
a change in rotational speed---and this is the essence of a continuously variable transmission.
