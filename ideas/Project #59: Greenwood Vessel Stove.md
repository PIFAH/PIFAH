# Greenwood Vessel Stove

About a billion people still cook everyday on a hand-gathered deadfall firewood. This is a time consuming drudgery and inefficient. Such wood has a low heating value,
and generally is not dried before burning, significantly decreasing its efficiency. 

Public Invention has another project, the EcoPot, which is an attempt to address this.

However, I am coming to believe that we need a stove-based solution.

Clearly, simply buying a people a $300 wood stove would, in fact, be a very useful starting point. In fact this would be an excellent use of $300B.
However, we may ask if we can design something that is efficient enough to be self financing, or better.

I believe that if we take the step of using a sealed reaction vessel for the combustion, then many improvements become possible.
We can use the reaction vessel as a vacuum dryer. We can further more treat the exhaust gases to abate smoke and other polution. Finally,
we can use forced air, or even O2 enriched air, to hasten and improve combustion.

The idea of using a PSA oxygen concentrator seems like economic madness; but I am not sure it is. My calcuclations suggest that under ideal conditions
only 26 grams of carbon are required to heat a 12-cup pot of water to boiling. However, this is not possible if you are heating an enourmous amount
of N2 in the air as a wasted flue gas.

So the basic idea is to make a sealed and carefully controlled vessel. To this vessel we attach a vacuum pump for drying, and valved exit 
flue for waste treatment, an air input port, and an O2 input port.

We device a solar-powered system that is in a sense optional: if we get no power, the system behaves as a normal stove. If, however, during the day
the sun shines and gives us 24V power, we use it to hold a drying vacuum on fuel, and possibly warm it. Possibly we can increase the pressure and
explosively release it to "puff" the wood, making it more porous, driable, and combustible. Drying takes time, but if cooking is a daily process,
we have time. Fuel is placed in the chamber in an untreated state and begins drying as power allows. Eventually, it may even be charged. If power allows 
and we have a O2 concentrator, we can store up compressed O2. At the time of cooking, the fuel is ignited and O2 injected up to the pressure and 
heat limits that we can tolerate. This requires careful control, but we have already commited to an electronic control system with sensors.

Using Pure O2 means the fire burns hot and fast; much of the heat will be radiant. But this will be captured in the stove and heat the stop top
without the loss of hot flue gases.

Eventually, we will be unable to add additional O2, so we open the exhuast port and take flue gases (which are now cooler due to time than they
would be if uncontrolled) into a pollution abatement exhaust system. This makes room for the injection of more O2 until the cooking is finished.
If we run out of O2, we can force air into the stove, which is less efficient but accomplished the same effect.
