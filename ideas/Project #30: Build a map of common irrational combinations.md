# Identifying Irrational Numbers

In a sense, it is not possible to identify when a decimal expansion, of any given length, represents and irrational number. 
If we perform some numeric calculation using a computer that is not performing symbolic computation and discover that a decimal
expansion is the same as the decimal expansion of the square root of 3 to the first 20 digits, we have no proof that it is
really the square root of 3.

But it seems that with each matching digit of precision the probability that we really have computed the sqare root of 3 and
somehow lost track of that information seems to go up.

This happens all the time, in particular whenver we take a SIN or COS function with a computer, which is rarely done symbolically.

It would be interesting to write a computer program that builds a map of commonly occuring irrational numbers. There are
known enumerations of all rationals, which generate rationals in an order to close to what a human being would call "simple".
We could create a similar enumeration that included "simple" irrationals. It would perhaps be fun to map these points
on a number line.

But more importantly, we could take any decimal expansion and compute how close it is such a number. This might give us
a hint that we have in fact computed a "simple" irrational, like the square root of 37.  Then we could back back over
our computation seeking ways to make it an exact symbolic computation rather than a floating-point computation.

Professor Norman J. Wildberger has eloquently demonstrated in his book "Divine Proportions" and in his YouTube videos
the value of performing exact rational (that is, symbolic) computations whereever possible as opposed to using 
floating point numbers, which are almost always an approximation which introduces inaccuracies. Inspired by his
work, I suggest this project as a fun (not terribly serious) exercise.

Wildberger has demonstrated that his method can find "simple" rational solutions containing only limited irrational numbers
to solve any arbitrary triangle, something which cannot be done with standard trigonometric circular functions. A 
test of this proposed irrational identifier would be to solve triangles with standard computer-based trigonmetric 
functions, which produce long, fairly accurate decimal expansions (called floating-point numbers) and see if 
the system could recover the inherent structure that Wildberger's Rational Trigonometry reveals.

If it could, it would further expose that the way we perform trigonometry today (using the approximate circular functions)
is a little silly.
